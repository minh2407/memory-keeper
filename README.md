## Introduction

Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB to build a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish. The App is called "Memory Keeper" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

The MERN Stack works.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app

TODO: rename post message, refactor reducers, add some cool memories, maybe clickable tags, fix update functionality
